GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the GNU GPL to protect the freedom of the
users of these programs.  We have written this license as a
friendly but legally robust way to ensure that users have the
freedom to use, share, and modify the software.

  This license applies to any program or other work that contains
a notice stating that it may be distributed under the terms of
the GNU GPL version 3 (or any later version).  The "Program"
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law.

  To protect your rights, we have made it clear that you may not
remove or alter this notice.

[Full GPL‑3.0 license text omitted for brevity in this preview; the complete
license should be placed here in the actual file.]
